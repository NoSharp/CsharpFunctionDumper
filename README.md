# CSharp Function Dumper

An application to dump .net PE files, into a nicely formatted output file.

##Why?
So you can easily add documentation, or interface with other application without
access to source files. It also doesn't require Reflection to handle the PE files,
and the parser is implemented in it's entirety is implemented here. You can also 
use this application programatically instead of having to rely on a heavy
decompiler.

##Issue?
Create an issue I'll fix it.
